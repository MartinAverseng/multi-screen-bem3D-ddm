This Matlab code is a prototype for a 2D and 3D boundary element code to solve integral equations on non-manifold geometries.
It has been used to obtain the numerical results from <link here>.

To reproduce the figures of this paper, open Matlab in the folder FiguresScripts and run with appropriate parameters.
Note that the 3D BEM assembling routine requires the use of a mex file which calls a parallel C++ code.
The compilation of the mex file may depend on your specific configuration. 

The library uses:
- The Matlab toolboxes openMsh, openDom, openFem and openHmx from https://github.com/matthieuaussal/gypsilab
This is a code developed by Fran√ßois Alouges and Matthieu Aussal for fast FEM and BEM simulations on Matlab.
