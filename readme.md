This Matlab code is a prototype for a 2D and 3D boundary element code to solve integral equations on non-manifold geometries.
It has been used to obtain the numerical results from <link here>.

To reproduce the figures of this paper, open matlab in the folder FiguresScripts and run with appropriate parameters.
Note that the 3D BEM assembling routine requires the use of a mex which calls a parallel C++ code.
The compilation of the mex file may depend on your configuration.
