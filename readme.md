This Matlab code is a prototype for a 2D and 3D boundary element code to solve integral equations on non-manifold geometries.
It has been used to obtain the numerical results from <link here>.

To reproduce the figures of this paper, open Matlab in the folder FiguresScripts and run with appropriate parameters.
Note that the 3D BEM assembling routine requires the use of a mex file which calls a parallel C++ code.
The compilation of the mex file may depend on your specific configuration. If necessary, the call to bemAssembly 
can be replaced by slowBemAssembly, which uses a non-optimized Matlab code. 

The library uses:
- The Matlab toolboxes openMsh, openDom and openFem from https://github.com/matthieuaussal/gypsilab
This is code developed by Fran√ßois Alouges and Matthieu Aussal to handle mesh and finite element integration in 2D and 3D
- The Matlab toolbox GeneralizedMesh, which contains the "intrinsic inflation" algorithm which converts a msh object into a gen-mesh, a mesh structure designed for FEM and BEM in non-manifold geometries. 
This is based on https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168874X22001809
- A self-contained excerpt from the C++ code bemTools by Xavier Claeys, contained in hypersingular.cpp, quadrature.cpp 
It implements Duffy-type quadratures to treat the singular integrals in the boundary element method.
